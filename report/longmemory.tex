In David Shelly's LFE catalog, do we have a lower rate of LFEs when the number of stations decreases (at the end of the dataset)? \\

Can we find a daily periodicity in the LFE catalog because of cultural noise? \\

The aggregation of short-range dependence time series can lead to a long-range dependence time series (see Jan Beran's book page 14, and a paper by Granger). Could an ETAS model with correlation between asperities lead to a model with long-range dependence?
