		\frametitle{Slow earthquakes}

	\subsection{Sow slip}

		\frametitle{Slow slip}
		% Here image of slow slip adapted for northern cascadia {sesimogenic zone under water, ETS zone under continent)

	\subsection{Tectonic tremor}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Tectonic tremor}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Long (several seconds to many minutes)
			\item Low amplitude
			\item Emergent onsets
			\item Absence of clear impulsive phases
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\end{frame}

	\subsection{Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs)}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Small magnitude earthquakes (M $\sim$ 1)
			\item Frequency content (1-10 Hz) lower than for ordinary earthquakes (up to 20 Hz)
			\item Source located on the plate boundary,
			\item Focal mechanism: Shear slip on a low-angle thrust fault dipping in the same direction as the plate interface
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\subsection{Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS)}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Tectonic tremor observations spatially and temporally correlated with slow slip observations (Nankai, Cascadia)
			\item Only biggest tremor episode associated with slow slip
			\item No spatial or temporal correlation in other regions like New Zealand
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\subsection{Research questions}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Depth of the source of the tectonic tremor in the eastern Olympic Peninsula}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Lack of impulsive phases $\rightarrow$ Difficult to determine the depth of the source of the tremor
			\item Tectonic tremor is at least partly made of a swarm of LFEs
			\item LFEs are located on the plate boundary
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{block}{}
			$\rightarrow$ Research question: Is the source of the tectonic tremor located on the plate boundary? What is the depth extent of the location of the source of the tremor?
		\end{block}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{A low-frequency earthquake catalog for Northern California}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item LFEs grouped into families of events
			\item All the earthquakes of a given family originate from the same small patch on the plate interface
			\item LFEs recur more or less episodically in a bursty manner
			\item Wide range of recurrence behavior between seismic regions, and within the same seismic region
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{LFEs in Washington State}
		% Here map of LFE families from Sweet et al. (2019)
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{LFEs on the San Andreas Fault}
		% Here map of LFE families from Shelly (2017)
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{A low-frequency earthquakes catalog for southern Cascadia}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item LFE families in southern Cascadia:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 34 LFE families on the subduction zone
				\item 3 LFE families on two strike-slip faults from the San Andreas Fault system
			\end{itemize}
			\item Wide range of recurrence behavior between Washington State and the San Andreas Fault, and within the San Andreas Fault zone
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{block}{}
			$\rightarrow$ Do low-frequency earthquakes families behave similarly or differently in southern Cascadia, compared to Washington State and the San Andreas Fault?
		\end{block}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Detection of slow slip events in New Zealand}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Small (M $\sim$ 5) or long (several months) slow slip events are harder to detect
			\item In Cascadia, Mexico, tremor used as a proxy to study slow slip events
			\item Different pattern in northern new Zealand:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Tremor source located downdip of the slow slip on the plate boundary
				\item Tremor activity does not seem to increase during slow slip events
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{block}{}
			$\rightarrow$ Can we detect smaller and / or longer slow slip events in the absence of spatially and temporally correlated tectonic tremor?
		\end{block}
